# 🚀 TrashTrack - Smart Waste Management System

TrashTrack is an AI-powered **smart bin system** designed to efficiently manage waste using **machine learning** and IoT. The system detects waste types, monitors fill levels, and integrates with a web application for real-time tracking, waste collection, and company waste purchasing.

## 🏗 Features
- 🗑 **Smart Bins**: ML-based waste detection and fill level monitoring.
- 📍 **Map Integration**: Displays bin locations with latitude & longitude.
- 🚛 **Waste Collection System**: Optimized vehicle routes based on bin status.
- ♻ **Dumping Area Management**: Waste categorization for recycling or disposal.
- 🏢 **Company Portal**: Businesses can purchase waste via a simulated payment system.
- 🔔 **Notification System**: Alerts for full bins.
- 🔧 **Admin Panel**: Manual data management.
